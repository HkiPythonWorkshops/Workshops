# Workshop 8 Material: CSV files

## CSV files: the basics

CSV stands for "comma-separated values". It is a pretty basic data format but it is easy to parse in most programming languages, and even Excel knows how to handle it.

Basic CSV files look something like this:

```csv
name,occupation,age,country
Alexis,coder,28,Marocco
Pascal,artist,35,Indonesia
Jo,economist,24,France
```

The first row has the header: what is data in each column?
The rest of the rows are the actual data, separated by commas. 

So e.g.: `Alexis,coder,28,Marocco`
describes one person, with the following information:

name: Alexis
occupation: coder
age: 28
country: Marocco

#### Separator character

As the name of the data format implies, most often the character used to separate the values on a row is a comma. However, most other characters can be used, and other often-used characters and semicolon (;) and tab.



## Reading CSV files with Python

Python comes ready with tools for reading and writing CSV files. We first need to import the csv library using Ã¬mport, then open the file you want to read, and finally create a csv reader to read the CSV file's contents.



```python
import csv

with open('data1.csv', newline='') as csvfile:
    datareader = csv.reader(csvfile, delimiter=',', )
    for row in datareader:
        print(row)
```
