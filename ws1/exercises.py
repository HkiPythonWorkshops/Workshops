Exercise 5
            - Print "How much is the fish? It is: " and the value of 1+1 as a string
            - Convert these: 
                  "5" into an integer
                  3 into a float
                  300 into a string
            - How would you get a float as a result of this division: 100/3?

'''
Exercise 6

      - Save three numbers into num1, num2 and num3 and calculate their mean (average)
      - Save two names as name1 and name2 and say hello to both
      - a = 1 and b = 2. How would you swap their values? Use a third variable.

######### COMPARISONS AND CONDITIONALS
#########


'''
Exercise 7

      - Use ==, !=, >=, <=, > and < to compare some numbers (or strings!)
      - Let price be a number. Write an if/else clause that prints "That's expensive" if the 
            price is higher than 100, otherwise it should print "What a bargain!"
      - Write a program that recognizes at least three different capital cities. Using 
      if and elif, the code should print out the name of the country whose capital city it is. 
      E.g.: if the city is Paris, print "France", if the city is Rome, print "Italy", and so on. 
      Make an else clause in the end for cases where the city is not recognized.
